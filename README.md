ðŸ‘‹ Greetings from a newbie! I'm a technical writer with a background in enterprise software. I haven't worked on the developer side of documentation, but I've worked in software development as a product owner and enjoyed working collaboratively in that process.<br/>

I have two passions when it comes to writing. The first is making software understandable. It's common for documentation to focus on features, without giving the user a conceptual understanding of the tool. Often there is no indication of priority or sequence to documentation, much less how to fit the pieces together to fulfill a user-driven need. On the tactical level, I've enjoyed simplifying documentation and helping the user perform a specific task.<br/>

My second passion is driving for measurable results from the documentation. I want to tie my work to metrics, and it's satisfying to see those results.<br/>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about GitHub!<br/>
